## 📖 About the Project

**WriteStack** is a full-stack blog application that leverages **Appwrite** as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), eliminating the need to build and maintain a custom backend server. Users can create accounts, write rich blog posts, manage their content, and explore posts by others — all in a beautifully animated, responsive UI.

> This project was built to demonstrate BaaS integration in a real-world React application, covering authentication, database, file storage, and real-time features — all through Appwrite's SDK.
